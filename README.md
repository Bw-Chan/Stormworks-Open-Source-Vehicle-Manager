# Stormworks-Open-Source-Vehicle-Manger

This is the second part of your Server! yay

If you have any issues feel free to contact me, discord: bwchan (I will also keep an eye on the issues stuff but I might be a bit slower to do so since I will probably be doing other things)

> Please credit me if you can, if you do not want to then well me big sad.

This handles more advanced functions like:
- Vehicle Manipulation
- Player data state toggles
- Player data
- Admin Vehicle Manipulation

## Lets get Started!

For a guide to adding the addon to your server go to [Stormworks-Open-Source-Auth](https://github.com/Bw-Chan/Stormworks-Open-Source-Auth)

Saves me having to repeat myself :P
